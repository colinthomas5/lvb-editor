# lvb-editor
A basic editor for .lvb files from games that use the WayForward Engine

## Project Information
The goal of this project is to be a basic level editor for games made by WayForward that use the .lvb level format. This project is made specifically for compatability with .lvb files from Adventure Time: Secret of the Nameless Kingdom, however it may function with over WayForward games that use .lvb files.

## Development Log
2/16/25 - Project created. This includes the creation of main.py, which separates a .lvb file into four distinct layers (five counting name layer) and separates the layers into entities. All entities also utilize the fifth layer, which is exclusively used for the storing of entity names.
